# RenderVulkanOnRoblox
This is to force roblox to render in vulkan. you may get a bit more framerate depending on what GPU you have. for me, I have integrated graphic which is intel UHD graphics and it seems to do well with vulkan.

DOES IT WORK?
I think so ![image](https://github.com/Mustardnote3943/RenderVulkanOnRoblox/assets/76454686/3ea5ac92-e9fb-4ff8-9392-dd5d1c4eb083)
